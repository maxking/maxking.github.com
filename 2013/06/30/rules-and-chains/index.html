                <p>This post talks about the basic messaging flow in mailman and then a little
detail about what are rules and chains in Mailman. So a message can be injected
in mailman system using a LMTP server via
LMTP. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2033#section-4">LMTP</a>(Local Mail
Transfer Protocol) is a derivative of ESMTP(Extended SMTP), which is a extension
of well known SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). LMTP runner parses the
message into a tuple of type (mailing_list, message, message_data) and stores it
in a serialized form
called <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html">python
pickle(.pck)</a> file, which is then queued in either one of <i>incoming queue,
bounce queue or command processing queue</i>. If the message parsing fails then
it is discarded. Queues are nothing but a set of directories managed
by <i>switchboards</i>, where all the messages are stored till a <i>runner</i>
wakes up and sends them one by one for processing according to the queue that
they were queued in, e.g. IN runner sends to file to pipeline queue where i
Below is a graph is decided if the message will be accepted, discarded or held
for moderation. Below is a graph depicting the message flow in mailman.</p>

<p>How is it decided if a message is 'fit' for posting? This process is
called <i>Moderation</i> where a message is tested against a set of rules. Rules
are simple checks which return True if the rule hits and False in-case it
misses. Moderation does not change anything in message, but it may record the
processing information(like rule hits and misses) information in a metadata
dictionary. Each rule has the following structure:</p>


@implementer(IRule)
class New_Rule:

    def check(self, mlist, msg, msgdata):
        if foo == foobar:
            return True
        else:
            return False

<p>
You can write your own rules to check whatever criteria you want mailman to
check before accepting the message. All the rules reside
inside <b>/src/mailman/rules/</b> in mailman source code. All of the rules are
arranged in a sequential manner to create a <b>chain</b>. Each list has two
default start chains associated with it - first for normal postings and second
one is for admin postings. The incoming runner checks who the message is
addressed to and accordingly the moderation occurs for admin or normal postings.
</p>

<p>The <b>default-builtin-chain</b> has a predefined list of rules to check
before the message is discarded, held or accepted. In mailman3 the list is as
follows in the order in which they are called:</p>



    _link_descriptions = (
        ('approved', LinkAction.jump, 'accept'),
        ('emergency', LinkAction.jump, 'hold'),
        ('loop', LinkAction.jump, 'discard'),
        # Determine whether the member or nonmember has an action shortcut.
        ('member-moderation', LinkAction.jump, 'moderation'),
        # Do all of the following before deciding whether to hold the message.
        ('signature', LinkAction.jump, 'discard'),
        ('administrivia', LinkAction.defer, None),
        ('implicit-dest', LinkAction.defer, None),
        ('max-recipients', LinkAction.defer, None),
        ('max-size', LinkAction.defer, None),
        ('news-moderation', LinkAction.defer, None),
        ('no-subject', LinkAction.defer, None),
        ('suspicious-header', LinkAction.defer, None),
        # Now if any of the above hit, jump to the hold chain.
        ('any', LinkAction.jump, 'hold'),
        # Take a detour through the header matching chain, which we'll create
        # later.
        ('truth', LinkAction.detour, 'header-match'),
        # Check for nonmember moderation.
        ('nonmember-moderation', LinkAction.jump, 'moderation'),
        # Finally, the builtin chain jumps to acceptance.
        ('truth', LinkAction.jump, 'accept'),
     )



<p>In the above list each entry consists of a tuple of the
form <span class="inline-code"> ('rule_name', LinkAction.action,
'target')</span>. The first element ,as evident from the name, is the name of
the rule that is to be called, the second element tell about what action is
taken if the rule hits(or return True). The last part is the target queue to
which the message is copied to if the rule hits(or you may customise it of course
for when rule misses), it is `None` incase the rule does not have
action. According to your convenience you can create your own chains. In the
above list the <b>signature</b> rule is the one I added to check for
openpgp-signature.
