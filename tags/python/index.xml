TDD (test driven development) is a good habit to cultivate, in case you are not convinced, you don't know about TDD or you have never given it a try. I started using partial TDD recently, yes only partial for what I follow is that first I write a rough outline of the code, then I write tests and then I keep on re-factoring my code till all the tests are passing.</description></item><item><title>GNUPG and python</title><link>https://asynchronous.in/2013/07/16/stuck-at-gnupg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asynchronous.in/2013/07/16/stuck-at-gnupg/</guid><description>So this post talks about what gpg is, what are the various problems that can be solved using gpg and about python-gnupg library which can be used to sign a message or file using python
For now python-gnupg allows detached signatures from file type objects, but what if we want to verify some text with a detached signature in the form on string in out application? StringIO module has been of some help but I am up researching how to use it better.</description></item></channel></rss>
