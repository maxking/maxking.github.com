      <description>Wondering what is ethical hacking? The term hacking has been so much misinterpreted in common day language that people had to coin a new term called &#39;ethical hacking&#39;, just to be clear that all hackers do not rob-the-bank. So what does the term hacker actually mean? Simply that i am a curious person who likes to peep in other&#39;s codes or scribble an entirely new one. Did you ever heard of the term &#39;ethical barber&#39;,&#39;ethical librarian&#39;,ethical doctor&#39;?</description>
