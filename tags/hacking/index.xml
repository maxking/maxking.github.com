The term hacking has been so much misinterpreted in common day language that people had to coin a new term called 'ethical hacking', just to be clear that all hackers do not rob-the-bank. So what does the term hacker actually mean? Simply that i am a curious person who likes to peep in other's codes or scribble an entirely new one. Did you ever heard of the term 'ethical barber','ethical librarian',ethical doctor'?</description></item></channel></rss>
