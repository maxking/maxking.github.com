_Problem_ : Some servers in my university are beind firewall and it is difficult
to ssh to those servers as I always use a VPN service on my primary laptop. To
be able to ssh, one must be inside the university or use the university VPN.

It is possible to ssh to a public facing server and go through that to any
server inside of the unversity. It is almost like running a campus VPN, but it
is a 2 step process. So in search for a better solution I found this:


```

Host <host-alias>
        User <username>
        Hostname <hostname>
		ProxyCommand ssh <hostname:port for public facing server> exec nc %h %p
        IdentityFile <private-key>
        Port 22
        Compression yes
        CompressionLevel 6
```

This configuration allows you to run `nc` on the public facing server and ssh
directly to the server behind the firewall. Note that the magic happend in the
4th line of the configuratoin with `ProxyCommand`. Pretty neah eh?
