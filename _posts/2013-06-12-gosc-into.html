<p>In this post I will first start with my introduction in brief and then move
on to my gsoc project. I am a undergrad student
at <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>
doing my majors in Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering
expecting to pass out in 2015. This summer I will be working for GNU Mailman
under Python Software Foundation for my gsoc project -
<i>Implementation of OpenPGP with Mailman.</i><p>

While many of you might be aware about what OpenPGP/GPG is, but for those of you
who don't I will try to introduce it in brief. OpenPGP is the world's most
widely used email encryption/signing standard. It was originally derived from
PGP( Pretty Good Privacy ), first created
by <a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/background/index.html">Phil
Zimmermann</a> in 1991. GPG( Gnu Privacy Guard ) is complete free implementation
of OpenPGP and comes with most of linux distros today with a default command
line and various other GUI tools. Although I have mentioned GPG in reference to
emails, it can be used to sign/encrypt any text or file. You can encrypt files
on your disk. If you see its actually analogous to email -- you are sending some
encrypted data to future-you and want that the data remains same and protected
when future-you receives it.
</p>
<p>
I remember when first time I asked Steve about how should OpenPGP be implemented
in mailman? He answered "<i>It depends on what OpenPGP means to you</i>". There
are a lot of things that you can do with OpenPGP but not all is of our interest
here. A very brief description of my project is : You digitally sign your email;
send it to mailman; mailman checks your signature(analogous to physical
signatures); verifies that its you; mailman then signs the emails itself; sends
it to all the subscribers. You want to know what <i>Mailman</i>
is? <a href="http://www.list.org/"> Mailman </a> is the GNU mailing list
software which can be used for e-newsletters and few other purposes
too. Currently Mailman3 is under <a href="https://launchpad.net/mailman">
development </a> along with its web interface(Postorius)and the
archiver(Hyperkitty).</p>
<p>
So coming back to my project, what do you actually mean by signing an email? A
typical OpenPGP signed message looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Kindly reply in a signed email only.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

<p>
The <b>Hash</b> tells about the hashing algorithm used to create the signature,
then there is the actual message followed by the signature. This is a ascii
coded signature so that it can be attached in emails without problems of
unsupported charset. The signature is actually a gibberish text created by
processing your message, using your secret-key, which is very difficult to
reproduce without your secret-key. Because of this reason it acts as your
signature, a mark of your <i>ownership</i> of the message. I will come up with a
detailed post on OpenPGP signature types and application soon.
