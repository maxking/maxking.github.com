<p>So I have pushed my final commit for now for my GSoC project. I will try
to be brief on all the accomplishments and mention concisely
what-is-working.</p>

<ul>
<li> Signature rule following strict rfc 3156 can now be verified, only
pgp-mime messages are accepted and messages without a (valid) signature
are held.</li>

<li>SignMessage handler creates multipart/signed message, first of whose
part is the original message formed after all the processing(in
default-posting-pipeline this handler is at last before the message is
send out or copied to nntp or any other queue). It expects a
`multipart/signed` or `multipart/mixeed` message. The signature is
calculated on whole part using the list's secret key.
</li>

<li>A List's key can be created from postorius and other signature
parameters can also be changed from there( only 'signature_max_age for
now).</li>

<li> A user can import his public key from public keyservers( defaults to
ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net) by entering their public key id or they can
copy paste their public key data to upload their public key.( Exceptions
handling is not implemented yet in postorius, if works fine in perfect
situations).</li>
</ul>

<p>I will soon come up with post more detailed about how my project functions,
but for now if anyone wants to have a look my code it
is <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~raj-abhilash1">here</a></p>.
