<p>So this post talks about what gpg is, what are the various problems that can
be solved using gpg and about python-gnupg library which can be used to sign a
message or file using python</p>

<p> For now python-gnupg allows detached signatures from file type objects, but
what if we want to verify some text with a detached signature in the form on
string in out application? StringIO module has been of some help but I am up
researching how to use it better. Once I am done with it I will resume to this
post.</p>
