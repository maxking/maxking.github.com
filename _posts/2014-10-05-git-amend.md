While this may be a very known feature of git, I still would add a note
about it here for my own reference. Git has this awesome feature where
you can amend you last commit. It comes pretty handy when you accidentally
forgot to add something to you last commit.

All you have to do is:


    git add <file>
    git commit --amend
