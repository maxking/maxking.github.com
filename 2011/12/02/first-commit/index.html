<p>I am not much of a blogger but i started this weblog so that i keep writing and also to improve coding skills.
This site is based on <a href=http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll title=jekyll>Jekyll</a>, a ruby based static
site generator.
<p>Since this is my first post i would write a little about myself. I am not a hardcore hacker. A little geeky guy
with a good sense of humour. I love working in linux. Currently i am using <a href=www.debian.org title=debian>
debian</a>. I have an experince of <a href=http://ubuntu.com title=ubuntu>Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04</a>. In a
hurry sometimes i use windows but linux brings a big smile on my face sometimes, when i discover some new
functionality. I enjoy sleeping. I enjoy reading fiction. At times i spend long time googling random things and
reading new things.
<p>I hope this blog proves useful and fullfills the purpose it was meant to.
