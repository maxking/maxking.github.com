It is possible to ssh to a public facing server and go through that to any server inside of the unversity. It is almost like running a campus VPN, but it is a 2 step process.">

to ssh to those servers as I always use a VPN service on my primary laptop. To
be able to ssh, one must be inside the university or use the university VPN.</p><p>It is possible to ssh to a public facing server and go through that to any
server inside of the unversity. It is almost like running a campus VPN, but it
is a 2 step process. So in search for a better solution I found this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Host &lt;host-alias&gt;
        User &lt;username&gt;
        Hostname &lt;hostname&gt;
        ProxyCommand ssh &lt;hostname:port for public facing server&gt; exec nc %h %p
        IdentityFile &lt;private-key&gt;
        Port 22
        Compression yes
        CompressionLevel 6
</code></pre><p>This configuration allows you to run <code>nc</code> on the public facing server and ssh
directly to the server behind the firewall. Note that the magic happend in the
4th line of the configuratoin with <code>ProxyCommand</code>. Pretty neah eh?</p><ul class=pa0>
