- [Samsung Knox](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/02/lifting-hyper-visor-bypassing-samsungs.html?m=0) is the next generation security platform for android phones that exists today only in Samsung smartphones. This is a very interesting read for those who are interested in cutting edge systems security and would like to know what is Samsung doing to protect your phones. The article dives deep into the workings of the Realtime Kernel Protection (RKP) and how engineers at Google were able to break the security provided by it.
- [CloudBleed](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139) - A very interesting cloud based memory corruption vulnerability in the services of a major cloud cdn provider, Cloudfare was found out. It leaked information from the memory due to improper bounds check in one of the cloudfare‚Äôs proxy servers. It turns out to have revealed everything from passwords to personal information and other user session data for cloudfare‚Äôs customers (which comprise of a HUGE list of very common websites including digitalocean, stackoverflow, medium etc. [Here](https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare) is a list of websites that were potentially affected by this vulnerability as they use Cloudfare‚Äôs affected services.

- Google Research [recently broke](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html?m=1) the SHA-1 hashing algorithm which means the softwares using it as a mechanism for Integrity checks can be fooled to accept a different file with same SHA1 hash. They released two different PDF Files which would result in same hash using SHA1.
- RedHat blog has a [good list](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/02/22/memory-error-detection-using-gcc/) of memory protections mechanism in the GNU GCC toolchain which provides security and memory safety from either programming error or malicious attacks
