I have been planning to rejuvenate this blog with a new design and hopefully some good posts! Before this, I used to publish this blog using Jekyll which is a great tool if you want to serve static website using Github Pages.
Jekyll is written in Ruby, which is one of the reasons I was planning to move away from it. I don&rsquo;t have anything against the language, but if you want to install Jekyll locally to test out your pages, you have to install the whole Ruby toolchain on your machine.

Prevent Git Push
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
It happens with me sometimes that I push to repositories that I must not push to. Being a GNU Mailman core-developer, I have push access to all the repositories. But, we always add changes to the master repo using merge-requests, even Barry does the same. But with my poor [Git] skills, I end up sometimes pushing to the wrong repository which might lead to bad code inside of the main repository.

SSH ProxyCommand
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Problem : Some servers in my university are beind firewall and it is difficult to ssh to those servers as I always use a VPN service on my primary laptop. To be able to ssh, one must be inside the university or use the university VPN.
It is possible to ssh to a public facing server and go through that to any server inside of the unversity. It is almost like running a campus VPN, but it is a 2 step process.

Basic GDB
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
GDB(The GNU Project Debugger) is one of the most awesome softwares ever built for C programmers. I recently started to write some code in C, specifically trying out socket programming and some other stuff. I had a very basic problem about how to debug a variable (bytes) without using the printf. I have been using printf since always to debug softwares in C and Python, but lets see something new today.

Python's GIL
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Recently I got very interested to explore about the GIL or the Global Interpreter Lock in Python that has been a topic of flame wars since forever. Global interpreter lock is a lock on the python interpreter, that a thread must acquire in order to run. Because of this, effectively any python program can have only one thread running at a time on one instance of python interpreter. However, it has been a common belief that threaded programming in Python doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all due to GIL, but that is not actually true.

Gitlab CI?
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Note: This post is now outdated. GNU Mailman now has a new container image for running tests and this time it just works. Being one of the core developers of GNU Mailman, I took up the task to setup a Continuous Integration server for Mailman. While looking for a service using FOSS and was free to use I stumbled upon Gitlab CI. There were several other options to choose from, but none of them fulfilled our requirement of using FOSS.

Git Undo
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Here are some useful git commands that helps to undo changes you knowingly or accidentally(my case) committed to a repo.
git commit - -ammend While this may be a very known feature of git, I still would add a note about it here for my own reference. Git has this awesome feature where you can amend you last commit. It comes pretty handy when you accidentally forgot to add something to you last commit.

Sshuttle VPN to bypass proxy
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Proxy servers in my college has made my life like a living hell. Blocking IRC and SSH is the worst thing that you can do to a developer I suppose. For past few years I have been trying to totally eliminate the problems associated with proxy, but was never successful. My previous attempt was to create a ssh tunnel using a amazon-ec2 instance and create a socks proxy to be used by applications.

GSoC Finale

So I have pushed my final commit for now for my GSoC project. I will try to be brief on all the accomplishments and mention concisely what-is-working.
Signature rule following strict rfc 3156 can now be verified, only pgp-mime messages are accepted and messages without a (valid) signature are held. SignMessage handler creates multipart/signed message, first of whose part is the original message formed after all the processing(in default-posting-pipeline this handler is at last before the message is send out or copied to nntp or any other queue).

Structure of Email

</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
This week I was busy investigating which kind of email does MUAs accept and display nicely. Now wait! What does *kind of email* and *MUA* mean?
Emails that you use everyday are of various types, much more than you would have though before. There are emails which can remove styling depending on the mail client where you are viewing the email. The email clients are generally called as MUA(Mail User Agent).
