<p>I am a undergraduate student at <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in">Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a> doing a dual degree course(B.Tech &
M.Tech) in Department of Metalurgical and Materials Engg. I am a self taught
programmer and web developer and usually work on python. Most of the work I have
done are centered to python, ruby on rails( not much of ruby ), and other web
languages including html, css and basic javascript. You might consider me a lazy
person but I think I do only what interests me. I love to eat and sleep as
evident from the caption in the title of this blog. Contact me if you want to
discuss anything related to my posts.</p>
