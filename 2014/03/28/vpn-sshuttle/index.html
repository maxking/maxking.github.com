SSH is the worst thing that you can do to a developer I suppose. For past few
years I have been trying to totally eliminate the problems associated with proxy,
but was never successful. My previous attempt was to create a ssh tunnel using
a amazon-ec2 instance and create a socks proxy to be used by applications. The
configuration was like below:</p><pre><code>Host amazon
 User ubuntu
 HostName 54.214.39.19
 Port 443
 ProxyCommand corkscrew &lt;proxy-address&gt; &lt;port&gt; %h %p
 IdentityFile /home/maxking/.ssh/my.pem
 Localforward 6667 irc.freenode.net:6667
 LocalForward 9930 imap.gmail.com:993
</code></pre><p>The above configuration coupled with <code>autossh</code> creates a socks proxy tunneling
all the data trough the ssh tunnel. A simple command that you can use is</p><pre><code>autossh -f -N -g -D 9999 amazon
</code></pre><p>This creates a socks proxy on localhost:9999 and tunnels all the request
trough the ssh tunnel created. <code>Autossh</code> helps to reconnect the ssh session
as soon as it breaks( which is very often behind my college proxy ).</p><p>Recently I came across another solution for this which made my life more easier,
<a href=%5Bhttps://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle%5D>sshuttle</a>. It is a &ldquo;Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man&rsquo;s
VPN. Forwards over ssh. Doesn&rsquo;t require admin. Works with Linux and
MacOS. Supports DNS tunneling.&rdquo;</p><p>So with the above setup I just have to run</p><pre><code>sudo sshuttle -r amazon 0/0 --dns -x 144.0.0.0 -x 10.0.0.0 -D
</code></pre><p>and all my requests without a proxy are forwarded over the tunnel and everything
seems to <strong>just work</strong>.</p><ul class=pa0>
