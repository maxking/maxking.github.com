  I am a Graduate Student working my way through a Computer Science major at
  Oregon State University. I am also a Core Developer
  for <a href="http://list.org"> GNU Mailman </a>project and have been working
  on it since past 3 years now. Mentoring Google Summer of Code students has
  also been one of contributions to the project. Apart from GNU Mailman, I enjoy
  working almost any Python project, because lets accept it, Python is FUN!
  Emacs and Linux are two piece of softwares that I use the most, but I am
  moving towards contributing to Linux.



  My research interests revolve around operating systems, systems security and
  programming languages. I have some experience juggling through the Linux
  Kernel source code, but none of them converted to an actual Patch.



  I am an open source enthusiast and I believe most softwares should be freely
  available for anyone to tinker with. Having said that, I understand the
  analogy behind having a proprietary software that was built for the purpose of
  making money and/or philanthropic purposes. But, even though making a software
  open source does not guarantee a superior quality of code or performance, it
  always gives a lone wolf or an independent organization an option to dive in
  and fix things that interests him/them and not depend on someone for that. For
  me, that is the biggest advantage of open source software. If there were
  someway to release the source code for a software and yet make money out it
  (something like Support/Professional Services but more easy and generic for a
  single developer), then it would be ideal.



  This blog doesn't actually have much informative blog posts and is just meant
  for me to pen down (or key down ;-) the things that I have been
  exploring. However, I am guilty of not updating it often. Not that I don't
  make a resolution every year to write more, till now it has been a huge
  failure. Hopefully someday maybe I will.
